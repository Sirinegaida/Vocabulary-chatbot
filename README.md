Neural Networks:
Basic Definition: A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain work. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
Deep Learning:
Basic Definition: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in data.
Stemming:
Stemming is a natural language processing technique used to reduce words to their base or root form. The goal of stemming is to simplify the analysis of text by grouping different inflected forms of a word so that they can be treated as the same item
Process: Stemming algorithms, known as stemmers, typically remove suffixes or prefixes from words to achieve their root forms. For example:

"running" → "run"
"better" → "better" (does not change)
"happiness" → "happi"

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular library in Python used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides tools and resources for working with human language data, making it easier to develop applications that process text. Here are some key functionalities and uses of NLTK:
Text Processing:

Tokenization: Splitting text into words or sentences.
Stopword Removal: Filtering out common words (e.g., "and," "the") that may not be useful for analysis.
Part-of-Speech Tagging:

Identifying the grammatical categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) of words in a sentence.
Text Classification:

Training models to categorize text into predefined classes (e.g., spam detection, topic classification).
